/*
Notes:
1.
When WeaponB was a reference " Weapon&	WeaponB;" I got the error:

"error: reference to type 'Weapon' requires an initializer
      WeaponB()"

can't do anything valid here with WeaponB 
if no Weapon is passed to the Constructor.

But since WeaponB is a reference, it must be initialized 
in the constructor's initializer list. If you don't 
have a Weapon at construction time, that's impossible.

2. 
void    HumanB::setWeapon(Weapon instance) {
    this->WeaponB = &instance; 
} 
   BAD: storing a pointer to a temporary object.

You pass Weapon instance by value. That means a copy 
of the weapon is made inside the function. When 
the function exits, instance is destroyed, 
and the memory is reclaimed.

Now WeaponB points to freed memory â€” a dangling pointer.
