2.3.1 References

The new standard introduced a new kind of pointer: 
an “rvalue pointer,” which we’ll cover in § 13.6.1 
(p. 532). These pointers are primarily intended 
for use inside classes. Technically speaking, when 
we use the term pointer, we mean “lvalue pointer.”

A pointer defines an alternative name for an object. 
A pointer type “refers to” another type.
