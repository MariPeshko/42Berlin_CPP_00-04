2.3.1 References

The new standard introduced a new kind of reference: 
an “rvalue reference,” which we’ll cover in § 13.6.1 
(p. 532). These references are primarily intended 
for use inside classes. Technically speaking, when 
we use the term reference, we mean “lvalue reference.”

A reference defines an alternative name for an object. 
A reference type “refers to” another type.
