2.3.1 References

The new standard introduced a new kind of  REPLACEMENT : 
an “rvalue  REPLACEMENT ,” which we’ll cover in § 13.6.1 
(p. 532). These  REPLACEMENT s are primarily intended 
for use inside classes. Technically speaking, when 
we use the term  REPLACEMENT , we mean “lvalue  REPLACEMENT .”

A  REPLACEMENT  defines an alternative name for an object. 
A  REPLACEMENT  type “refers to” another type.
